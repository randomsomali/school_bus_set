look at my current esp32 code @currentProject.ino  as you see we currently have manual setup of  serial for registtering , or etc , now i need to improe it to work with my backend 
this is my clear setup to achive this when i correctly register new student i need to poll the id of the student i mean instead of relying the serial monitor just poll the backend and get the last inserted  student fingerprint id  , do not wrorry i have many refrences to acheive this 
look how i did in my other project @arduino.ino @customer.routes.js @booking.controller.js @esp32.routes.js  when verified booking it polss the esp calls the poll and get the code etc 

can we acheive this also when deleted student poll also and receive the delete command for teh deleted student
